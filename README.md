👋 Hi, I’m @lgiraldor  
- 👩‍🔬 I’ve worked as a researcher in the field of protein biophysics, with 4 years of experience in experimental and computational approaches  
- 👀 I’m interested in proteins, RNA, DNA, genetics but MOSTLY macromolecular systems and understanding their behaviour through computation and research  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and improving my coding in R (Rstudio, Rmarkdown) and Python → I'm working on becoming a BIOINFORMATIC ANALYST  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on research and code-driven projects that not only explore complex biological systems but also contribute to solving under-addressed health and social challenges.
- 🌍 I'm strongly motivated by the potential of science to address global and social challenges — especially in areas like women's health, under-researched diseases (e.g. malaria), and supporting LGBTQIA+ communities through inclusive research  
- 🧭  I believe science holds the potential and the responsibility to challenge structures, transform society, and drive meaningful change. I'm committed to aligning my research with these values — pushing for inclusive, critical, and socially engaged science.
